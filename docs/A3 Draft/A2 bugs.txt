player attacks player (when near a goomba)
invicibility doesn't last 10 turns
display invicible message while active
fix monologue (power star doesnt remove the line) (change from inventory to invincible/used)
When mario gets attacked while super mushroom is activate, health does not reset
test reset removes invicibility once power star is working
When jumping to a sapling another jump action appears saying "Player jumps to   Sapling".
