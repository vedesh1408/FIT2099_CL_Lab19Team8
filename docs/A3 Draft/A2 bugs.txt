player attacks player (when near a goomba)
goomba doesnt always try to attack when near player
koopa does no damage
invicibility doesn't last 10 turns
display invicible message while active
fix monologue (power star doesnt remove the line) (change from inventory to invincible/used)
super mushroom doesnt increase max health by 50
test reset removes invicibility once power star is working
